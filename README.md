Deep fruit classification from aerial images

This is a machine learning project which runs on real time identification of fruits , if i use an arduino camera  and show a fruit towards the camerathe algorithm recognises the fruit (in this case only 4 fruits becasue thats our dataset)

fruits.zip is the dataset
